    <abstract>
      <t>
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-extended-icmp-nodeid" /> describes a 
        mechanism for Extending ICMP for Node Identification, which allows 
        providing a unique IP address and/or a textual name for the node, 
        in the case where each node may not have a unique IP address.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document introduces a similar ICMP extension for Component
        Identification.  It gives us an option to send locally defined component
        details (like interfaces, fans, PSUs, etc.) or YANG/NETCONF defined 
        components in the ICMP message. The true potential of this extension 
        object is when it is used along side other extension objects which 
        might want to send compontent based data (like in the component 
        based Sub-Objects defined in <xref target="I-D.pignataro-green-enviro-icmp" />)
      </t>
      <t>
        The goal of this document is to not limit the data that the device sends
        or not serve as a replacemtn to YANG. But, to give additional freedom 
        and allow the administrative domain or outside ad to send limited component 
        identifiers that is just locally significant to a AD/flow and which are not
        dependent on extra configuration or implementations.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        IP devices use the Internet Control Message Protocol ICMPv4
        <xref target="RFC0792" /> and ICMPv6 <xref target="RFC4443" /> to
        convey control information to source hosts. In particular, when an 
        IP device receives a datagram that it cannot process, it may send 
        an ICMP message to the datagram's originator or source. Network 
        operators and higher-level protocols use these ICMP messages to 
        detect and diagnose network issues.
      </t>
      <t>
        Due to this reason, there have been a lot of efforts to extend these 
        ICMP messages to append some very useful information which can be 
        used for advanced debugging, identification of nodes or interfaces, 
        etc. But there still is a need for more granular controls which can 
        help in a deeper understanding of a flow. i.e. component identification.
      </t>
      <t>
        Now, there already are ways whcih can help one get details about a 
        component, YANG/NETCONF being one of them. But, what if a user wants to 
        define their own list of components for a particular administrative 
        domain or for a particular flow of communication?
      </t>
      <t>
        This document serves that need by defining an ICMP extension 
        object that appends component identifiers to ICMP messages. This object,
        can also serve as an sux object which can be used along side other 
        extension objects to correlate the data sent in those objects.
        e.g. If a device wants to send the power consumption of lets say 4 fans
        using the CTYPE=XX mentioned in <xref target="I-D.pignataro-green-enviro-icmp" />,
        it also needs a way to correlate the values to corresponding fans.
        One way is to use UUIDs from the YANG/NETCONF, but if there might not be a way to
        use those, it can simply use the component identification object defined 
        here and send it along the component power consumption subobject.
