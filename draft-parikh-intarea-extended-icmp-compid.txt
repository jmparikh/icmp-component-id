              Extending ICMP for Component Identification
              draft-parikh-intarea-extended-icmp-compid-00

Abstract

   [I-D.ietf-intarea-extended-icmp-nodeid] describes a mechanism for
   Extending ICMP for Node Identification, which allows providing a
   unique IP address and/or a textual name for the node, in the case
   where each node may not have a unique IP address.

   This document introduces a similar ICMP extension for Component
   Identification.  It gives us an option to send locally defined
   component details (like interfaces, fans, PSUs, etc.) or YANG/NETCONF
   defined components in the ICMP message.  The true potential of this
   extension object is when it is used along side other extension
   objects which might want to send compontent based data (like in the
   component based Sub-Objects defined in
   [I-D.pignataro-green-enviro-icmp])

   The goal of this document is to not limit the data that the device
   sends or not serve as a replacemtn to YANG.  But, to give additional
   freedom and allow the administrative domain or outside ad to send
   limited component identifiers that is just locally significant to a
   AD/flow and which are not dependent on extra configuration or
   implementations.

1.  Introduction

   IP devices use the Internet Control Message Protocol ICMPv4 [RFC0792]
   and ICMPv6 [RFC4443] to convey control information to source hosts.
   In particular, when an IP device receives a datagram that it cannot
   process, it may send an ICMP message to the datagram's originator or
   source.  Network operators and higher-level protocols use these ICMP
   messages to detect and diagnose network issues.

   Due to this reason, there have been a lot of efforts to extend these
   ICMP messages to append some very useful information which can be
   used for advanced debugging, identification of nodes or interfaces,
   etc.  But there still is a need for more granular controls which can
   help in a deeper understanding of a flow. i.e. component
   identification.

   Now, there already are ways whcih can help one get details about a
   component, YANG/NETCONF being one of them.  But, what if a user wants
   to define their own list of components for a particular
   administrative domain or for a particular flow of communication?

   This document serves that need by defining an ICMP extension object
   that appends component identifiers to ICMP messages.  This object,
   can also serve as an sux object which can be used along side other
   extension objects to correlate the data sent in those objects.  e.g.
   If a device wants to send the power consumption of lets say 4 fans
   using the CTYPE=XX mentioned in [I-D.pignataro-green-enviro-icmp], it
   also needs a way to correlate the values to corresponding fans.  One
   way is to use UUIDs from the YANG/NETCONF, but if there might not be
   a way to use those, it can simply use the component identification
   object defined here and send it along the component power consumption
   subobject.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
